# Anchor-Assessment

To open this project, simply open the Anchor-Assessment.sln project in Visual Studio. I used VS2019, but newer versions should work just fine.

To run the APIs, set the Anchor-Assessment.csproj as the startup project (right-click, set as startup project), and click the IIS Express button at the top.

To run the unit tests, go to Test > Run All Tests in VS and it should open up the Test Explorer.
